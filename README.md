# CodeAlpha-_Data-Analytics-Project
📊 CodeAlpha Data Analytics Internship Projects
🎯 Overview

This repository contains the completed tasks for the CodeAlpha Data Analytics Internship, where I applied Python-based data analysis, web scraping, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and data visualization techniques on real-world datasets to extract meaningful insights and support data-driven decision-making.

✅ Tasks Completed

Task 1: Web Scraping

Task 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Task 3: Data Visualization

🧹 Task 1: Web Scraping — Books to Scrape
🔍 Objective

Extract book titles and prices from BooksToScrape.com using Python and BeautifulSoup, and store the data in a structured format for analysis.

🛠️ Tools Used

Python

requests

BeautifulSoup

pandas

🚀 What I Did

Fetched HTML content using HTTP requests

Parsed book titles and prices using BeautifulSoup

Stored the scraped data into a CSV file

📁 Output

File: books_data.csv

📊 Task 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) — Flipkart Smartphones Dataset
🔍 Objective

Perform data cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Flipkart Smartphones dataset to identify patterns related to pricing, ratings, brands, processors, and specifications, and understand factors influencing customer preferences.

🛠️ Tools Used

Python

pandas – data cleaning and manipulation

numpy – numerical operations

matplotlib & seaborn – static visualizations

plotly.express – interactive charts

warnings – handling runtime warnings

🚀 What I Did

Cleaned and prepared the dataset by handling missing values and formatting columns

Analyzed key variables such as Brand, Price, Ratings, RAM, Storage, Processor, and Battery Type

Segmented smartphones into Budget, Mid-Range, Upper Mid-Range, and Flagship categories

Compared brand-wise ratings, price distribution, and processor popularity

📈 Key Insights

Apple and OnePlus show consistently high ratings with tightly clustered distributions

Budget brands offer more models but display high variability in ratings

Premium and flagship smartphones dominate the top-rated segment

Qualcomm Snapdragon and MediaTek are the most widely used processors

Higher-priced phones generally receive better ratings, with a few exceptions

Apple’s Bionic processors maintain strong and consistent performance

✅ Conclusion

Brand reputation, price segment, and processor type significantly influence smartphone ratings on Flipkart. Premium brands deliver more consistent user satisfaction, while budget segments offer greater variety with rating fluctuations.

📈 Task 3: Data Visualization — Flipkart Smartphones Dataset
🔍 Objective

Create meaningful visualizations to clearly represent patterns, trends, and relationships in the dataset, enabling better understanding of pricing, ratings, and brand performance.

🛠️ Tools Used

Python

matplotlib – basic and comparative plots

seaborn – statistical visualizations

plotly.express – interactive charts

🚀 What I Did

Created bar charts for brand-wise smartphone counts and average ratings

Used histograms to analyze price and rating distributions

Designed box plots to study rating variations across brands and price segments

Built count plots for processor and RAM popularity

Developed interactive plots for deeper exploration

📊 Visualizations Created

Brand vs Number of Smartphones

Brand vs Average Ratings

Price Distribution Histogram

Ratings Distribution Histogram

Brand-wise Box Plot of Ratings

Price Segment-wise Rating Comparison

Processor Usage Distribution

📈 Key Insights

Premium brands show higher and more consistent ratings

Budget brands dominate in volume but show wider rating dispersion

Higher price segments generally correlate with better ratings

Snapdragon and MediaTek processors are most common across brands

Interactive visuals help easily identify outliers and brand-level differences

✅ Conclusion

Effective data visualizations made trends and relationships more intuitive, helping uncover customer preferences and market dynamics in the smartphone segment.
